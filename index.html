            <h2>Bio</h2>
            <p>My name is Paul Kerber and I am a 19-year-old Freshman attending McHenry County College. I am studying accounting, working towards an associate in applied science in accounting. I have always been interested in business and financial activities, so I am looking forward to working on that in the future. I have been an athlete my whole life and played sports all throughout high school and wanted to pursue a career in sports, but I felt like finances and business were more and more interesting the more I work and study. I am a hardworking and dedicated worker, and I am excited about the future.</p>
