            <p>I am currently employed at Woodman's Food Market as a Parcel/Cart employee. I have been employed here for just under 2 years. My role as an employee is to watch the parcel area where I fill up cars with parcel orders, attend to customers for propane sales, and make sure the front entrance is filled with carts. Also, I must go through the parking lot and collect all the carts from the corrals and bring them to 1 of the 3 entrances we have.</p>

            <p>I also volunteer to help at a furniture store whenever I have the time. We take orders of furniture and package them up and load the truck. We then deliver the ordered furniture to customersâ€™ homes. This work is fun and teaches me about orders and how business works all while doing some labor work.</p>
