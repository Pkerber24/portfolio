            <p>In the future, I plan to first get a new job. I am looking for a bank job of some sort right now while I finish schooling. After I get my associates in applied science in accounting, I will also be eligible to get my bookkeeping certificate. Therefore, I will then look for a bookkeeping job to start and work my way up in a company. Also, in the future is to start a family accounting business. I have always dreamt of having my own business with my family. So, I have a lot of ideas for the future, but I still have some ways to go.</p>
